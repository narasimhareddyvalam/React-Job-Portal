This project is a web application with a frontend-backend architecture, where the frontend resides in the client/ directory and the backend in the server/ directory. The frontend is built with a modern JavaScript framework (like React, Angular, or Vue) and uses a router for navigation between pages such as Home, Login, and Dashboard, with dynamic and programmatic navigation for seamless user interaction. The backend, built with Node.js and Express, handles API requests, authentication, and data processing, serving as the connection between the frontend and the database. The project structure is organized to separate concerns: client/ manages user-facing interfaces, server/ manages server-side logic, and the root directory includes configuration files like .gitignore and package.json. Navigation is achieved through a combination of frontend routing (for page rendering) and backend API routing (for fetching or submitting data), creating a smooth, interactive user experience
